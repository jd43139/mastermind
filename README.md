-The computer generates a random combination code of 4 digits.

-The computer asks the code breaker to guess the code .

-The computer gives feedback for the code breaker's guess.

-If the feedback section displays nB it means one of the digits included in the code but is not in the right position.(n Represents the number of digits)

-If the feedback section displays nR it means one of the digits included in the code but is not in the right position.(n Represents the number of the digits)

-This process is repeated until the code breaker match the code exactly or exceeds 12 trials
